Latin Enthusiasts Blog

What is it?
-----------

This is a blog platform made for the final project for the
PGCIT Course. Project specifications can be detailed in
Assignment-Handout.pdf

Installation
------------

An Apache Derby database needs to be created at the address:
jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/blog

Configuration settings for this database can be found in:
webapps/simplewebapp/WEB-INF/classes/simplewebapp/DatabaseDAO

This database needs to be set up using the file:
database.sql

To run this project, simply run runme.bat

Alternatively (i.e. if you are on linux), make sure your database
server is running, compile the project via compi..... nevermind,
just use windows :^)

Runme.bat has to be run from the commandline from the Final-Project
directory (i.e. root of this project).

The main page of the website can be found at:
http://localhost:8080/simplewebapp/?page=home
